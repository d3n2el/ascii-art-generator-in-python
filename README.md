# Ascii art generator
this is a text art generator that use the pyfiglet library to either output the user's input in a random font or a font chosen by the user. I chose to do this because i always thought ascii art was very cool as a kid and a saw that it was listed as a beginner python project online(apart from getting the library, i did everything myself, dont worry ;) )
